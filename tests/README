For test writers
================

If you are going to write new test classes, your class should most likely
inherit from one of the base classes in `helpers.py`. If you are going to write
new test methods, use the `self.app.getj`, `self.app.postj`, etc. methods
instead of the `self.app.get`, `self.app.post`, etc. methods; the former will
force the mimetype of the request to JSON, which is required for requests to
API endpoints created by Flask-Restless.
